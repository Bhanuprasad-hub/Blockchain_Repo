Introduction :-
  A Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography. 
  In otherwords, it is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial   transactions but virtually everything of value.
  
  Each block typically contains the cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data.
 
  The Blockchain works on the P2P(peer to peer) protocol where every node has an equal say in validating the transactions on the network.
