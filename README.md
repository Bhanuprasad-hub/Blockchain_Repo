# Blockchain based test player

Introduction :-
  A Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography. 
  In otherwords, it is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial   transactions but virtually everything of value.
  
  Each block typically contains the cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data.
 
  The Blockchain works on the P2P(peer to peer) protocol where every node has an equal say in validating the transactions on the network.
  
Idea behind this project:-
  This test player leverages blockchain technology by storing user responses with out manipulating, yet transactional details are kept unaltered in private cluster ethereum nodes. Data storing and mining rely on these nodes where responses can be changed or manipulate, but each and every transactions are kept in nodes to find the original and manipulates responses, which inturn helps to find malfunction activities done by proctors/evaluaters.
